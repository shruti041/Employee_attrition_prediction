# HR ANALYTICS FOR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION PREDICTION
### Introduction:
HR Analytics leverages data-driven insights to improve workforce management. One critical application is predicting employee attritionâ€”understanding why employees leave and identifying those at risk of leaving. This helps organizations retain talent, reduce turnover costs, and enhance productivity.
### Problem Statement:
The goal is to develop a predictive model using employee data to identify individuals likely to leave the organization. By analyzing factors like job role, satisfaction, workload, and compensation, HR teams can take proactive steps to improve retention.
### Data Acquisition
The data for the project is sourced from Kaggle and is made available to everyone. This information includes 1,470 records, each containing 35 details regarding employees. Dataset is added already, link is also provided here [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) .
#### After this we preprocess the dataset. 
### Model Development
We applied a range of machine learning algorithms and observed which did the best job in predicting.
